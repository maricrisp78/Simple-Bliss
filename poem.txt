[XXXVII., April 12, 1840.]


    My love flowed e'er for things with wings.
    When boy I sought for forest fowl,
    And caged them in rude rushes' mesh,
    And fed them with my breakfast roll;
    So that, though fragile were the door,
    They rarely fled, and even then
    Would flutter back at faintest call!

    Man-grown, I charm for men.
