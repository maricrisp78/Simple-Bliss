# False Love And True Logic


THE DISCONSOLATE

    My heart will break, I'm sure it will:
        My lover, yes, my favorite, he
    Who seemed my own through good and ill,
        Has basely turned his back on me.

THE COMFORTER

    Ah! silly sorrower, weep no more;
        Your lover's turned his back, we see;
    But you had turned his head before,
        And now he's as he ought to be.
